#Data Collection#

The `user` directory contains all of the data split by user. I did not change any of the files here.

The `trip` directory contains a program called `split.py` can be executed to splits the data found in `user` by trip. I used the labels `start` and `end` to find the trips in the data.

I think that there still needs to be error checking for this to be more robust.
